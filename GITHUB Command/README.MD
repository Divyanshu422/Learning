# Initializing the git Repo:

- Firstly we need to create a new directory [ which will work as a repository ] for our project using the mkdir command: `mkdir ${DirectoryName}`.
  - Navigate into the directory you created: `cd ${DirectoryName}`
- To turn the directory into a Git repository (so Git can start tracking changes), use the `git init` command.
  - This initializes an empty Git repository by creating a .git directory inside your project. The .git directory stores all the information Git needs to track changes to your project, like commit history and configuration.
